    <b>Projects by IceFireLabs</b>
</p>


Now, Web3 has great dreams and markets, but many dapps are walking on crowded similar tracks, and it is difficult to grow a rich and colorful multi-track application ecology like web2. Why is this? From a technical point of view, we can see that there is a huge infrastructure gap between web2 and web3. From storage, computing, security, communication, data retrieval, web3 is seriously lacking in infrastructure products to support the needs of many dapps in the development process. 

Therefore, we focus on the construction of infrastructure projects in IceFireLabs, focusing on storage and data retrieval, secure network communication, user digital identity, web3 database infrastructure, and the new infrastructure that empowers infrastructure around the upgrade process of dapp and web2 to web3 applications value.

For web3, IceFireLabs will not pay attention to crypto. We like the ecological consensus and motivation brought by crypto, but we hope that Web3 can become a reality and be widely used. Anyone is welcome to walk with us.
